# Task Based Language

What if all your functions were cyclical tasks? The *Task Based Language* (TBL) is an attempt
to create a programming language that captures the essentials of many realtime applications
by putting thÃ­s idea into the foreground.

TBL is still work in progress. While an example scheduler exists, many features are still
missing or only partially implemented. Use at your own risk!

## Example

```
extern task printf(...);    // (1)

global n: u32 = 0;          // (2)

task count(counter: &u32) { // (3)
    *counter = counter + 1;
    printf("%d\n", *counter);
    return;
}

task main() -> u32 {
    schedule count(&n);      // (4)
    return 0;
}
```

This example doesn't run yet, but this is the "Hello World" I'm working towards.
Comment (1) shows how easily you can integrate functions with a C ABI, e.g. a regular
libc function. For our example, we'll use a global value (see comment (2)) as our
task state. Comment (3) shows how you declare a task. TBL doesn't differentiate
between tasks and functions: even external functions can be used as tasks! Finally,
comment (4) shows how you can schedule a task. The default scheduler will be started
at the end of your main function, but you can also replace it with your own implementation.
