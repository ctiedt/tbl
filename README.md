# Task Based Language

What if all your functions were cyclical tasks? The *Task Based Language* (TBL) is an attempt
to create a programming language that captures the essentials of many realtime applications
by putting thÃ­s idea into the foreground.

This language is far from done (mainly the scheduler does not work yet and there are probably
hundreds of bugs I haven't caught yet), but the basics are usable.

## Example

```
extern task printf(...);    // (1)

task count(counter: &u32) { // (2)
    *counter = counter + 1;
    printf("%d\n", *counter);
    return;
}

task main() -> u32 {
    schedule count(0);      // (3)
    return 0;
}
```

This example doesn't run yet, but this is the "Hello World" I'm working towards.
Comment (1) shows how easily you can integrate functions with a C ABI, e.g. a regular
libc function. Comment (2) shows how you declare a task. TBL doesn't differentiate
between tasks and functions: even external functions can be used as tasks! Finally,
comment (3) shows how you can schedule a task. The default scheduler will be started
before your main function, but you can also replace it with your own implementation.
